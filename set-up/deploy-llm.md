### Deploy Large Language Models (LLM) 

1. Expand the ML Operations menu on the left and choose **Configurations**. 
    
    You need to create a configuration of the model. Choose **Create**.

    ![create button](img/create-config-button.png)

    First, let's create a configuration for the **text embedding** model. 

2. Provide the following information and choose **Next**.

    - Configuration Name: **openai-embedding-config**
    - Scenario: **foundation-models**
    - Version: **0.0.1**
    - Executable: **azure-openai**

    ![create config 1](img/emb-01.png)

3. Provide in the following information and choose **Next**.

    - modelName: **text-embedding-ada-002**  
    - modelVersion: **latest**  
    >ðŸ’¡**Tip**: Ensure that the model name matches exactly as specified. Optionally, you may include a version number as outlined in the [SAP Note](https://me.sap.com/notes/3437766). For this exercise, the `latest` version is used.

    **Now the deployment has started.** Monitor the status changes here. 

    On the deployment screen, you can see the Target Status is **RUNNING** and in the beginning, the Current Status is **UNKNOWN**.  Also, the deployment URL says *URL isn't available* until the model is deployed.  

    >ðŸ’¡**Tip**: The deployment process usually takes between 2 to 10 minutes, depending on the server's status, network, the number of parallel jobs, etc.  You can refresh the status by clicking the refresh icon on the top right of the screen. In the meantime, you can proceed with the following steps.

9. While you are waiting for your first model to be deployed, repeat the steps above to deploy a **gpt-4o** model. 

    Follow the configuration process. When it comes to "Enter Name and Executable", provide the following:

    - Configuration Name: **openai-gpt-4o-config**
    - Scenario: **foundation-models**
    - Version: **0.0.1**
    - Executable: **azure-openai**

    ![create config4 1](img/gpt4-c1.png)

    When it comes to "Input Parameters", provide the following:

    - modelName: **gpt-4o**  
    - modelVersion: **latest**  
    >ðŸ’¡**Tip**: Ensure that you enter the model name exactly as specified. Optionally, you can include a version number as outlined in the [SAP Note](https://me.sap.com/notes/3437766). For this exercise, the `latest` version is used.

    Proceed with creating the configuration and deploying the model.


10. While you are waiting for your first two models to be deployed, repeat the steps above to deploy a **claude-3.7** model. 

    Again, follow the configuration process. When it comes to "Enter Name and Executable", provide the following:

    - Configuration Name: **anthropic-claude-3.7-sonnet-config**
    - Scenario: **foundation-models**
    - Version: **0.0.1**
    - Executable: **aws-bedrock**

    ![create config claude 1](img/dp-1-claude35.png) 

    When it comes to "Input Parameters", provide the following:

    - modelName: **anthropic--claude-3.7-sonnet**   
    - modelVersion: **latest**   
    >ðŸ’¡**Tip**: Ensure that you enter the model name exactly as specified. Optionally, you can include a version number as outlined in the [SAP Note](https://me.sap.com/notes/3437766). For this exercise, the `latest` version is used.

    ![create config claude 2](img/dp-2-claude35.png) 

    Proceed with creating configuration and deploying the model.

After some time, you should see all models deployed and running.
