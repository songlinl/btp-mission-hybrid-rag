The SAP HANA Cloud knowledge graph engine is an integral part of SAP HANA Cloud. It is an addition to the SAP HANA Cloud mult model engines. It is designed for processing large-scale graph data and executing complex graph queries with high efficiency using knowledge graphs. SAP HANA Cloud knowledge graph engineenables organizations to gain insights from their graph datasets, discover patterns, perform advanced graph analytics and unlock the value of interconnected data.

The SAP HANA Cloud knowledge graph engine enables working with knowledge graphs. It is built using World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) web standards specifications of graph data called RDF (containing triples with the format subject-predicate-object) and its associated W3C web standards query language called SPARQL (see [Technical Concepts](https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-knowledge-graph-guide/technical-concepts?locale=en-US&state=PRODUCTION&version=2025_2_QRC)). Knowledge graphs are stored in a triple store.

### Business Benefits
- **Enhanced data contextualization**  
    RDF graphs organize and represent complex relationships within data, enabling businesses to embed domain-specific knowledge directly into applications. This improves decision-making by providing contextually relevant insights.

- **Improved AI and LLM performance**  
    By grounding large language models (LLMs) with knowledge graphs, businesses can ensure that AI-powered applications deliver more accurate and context-aware responses, enhancing the user experience.

- **Streamlined data integration**  
    Knowledge graphs facilitate the seamless integration of diverse data sources, breaking down silos and enabling a unified view of business data across the organization.

- **Enhanced user experience**  
    Knowledge graphs make AI interfaces more intuitive, allowing users to interact naturally with complex data systems, thereby improving user engagement and satisfaction.

- **The multi model advantage**  
    The ability to handle both structured and unstructured data within a single platform allows businesses to scale their applications easily while maintaining flexibility in data processing and analysis.

### Use Cases

- **Enhance your intelligent data applications and generative AI**  
    The in-memory database capabilities of SAP HANA Cloud provide high-performance data processing. The addition of SAP HANA Cloud knowledge graph engine enables applications to gain an extra layer of understanding. SAP HANA Cloud knowledge graph engine is particularly valuable when it comes to enabling Gen AI use cases, such as grounding large language models in domain-specific knowledge. By storing and retrieving semantic facts about a business's operations, relationships, and data, the knowledge graph can provide LLMs with the context they need to deliver more accurate and relevant responses, ultimately improving the quality of human-computer interaction.

- **Establish a data fabric**  
    With the SAP HANA Cloud knowledge graph engineworking seamlessly alongside the other multi model engines in SAP HANA Cloud, such as the relational data, spatial, graph, JSON document store, and vector engines, businesses can bring structured and unstructured data together in a single platform, establishing a data fabric. This unified approach allows companies to query and analyze data holistically, breaking down traditional data silos. The semantic linking of data creates a unified view, allowing for an accurate contextual understanding of complex concepts, such as the term "material" in different scenarios like manufacturing, sales, or procurement.

- **Improve decision making and logical inference**  
    Knowledge graphs contribute to better data governance by establishing clearer semantical relationships and rules for data entities, which improves logical reasoning and helps users make more informed, accurate decisions with fewer errors.
