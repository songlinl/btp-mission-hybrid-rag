Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLM) have led to increased awareness of and popularity for vector databases. Similarity search, a key functionality of vector databases, complements traditional relational databases as well as full-text search systems. Using natural language text as an example, embedding functions map data to high dimensional vectors to preserve their semantic similarity. Developers can then use vector-based semantic search to find similarity between different passages of text. Because the data within an LLM is current only up to a specific point in time, vector databases can offer additional relevant text to make searches more accurate â€“ known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Therefore, the addition of RAG to an LLM using a vector database like SAP HANA Cloud provides an effective approach to increase the quality of responses from an LLM.

### Business Benefits

- Simplify the data architecture, management, and security with the storage of vectors and other enterprise data within the same database.
- Interact with all types of data (including vectors) using SQL.
- Gain new insights into data by combining spatial, graph, JSON, and custom SQLScript with vector-based queries.
- Incorporate vector use cases in solutions with the SAP HANA Cloud clients (including Python), the Python Machine Learning Client for SAP HANA (hana-ml), and the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP).

### Use Cases

The SAP HANA Cloud vector engine supports the create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations involving vectors using SQL. The ability to determine similarity among vectors enables use cases such as the following:

- Semantic search
- Natural language processing (NLP)
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Similarity search
- Recommendations
- Classifications
- Clustering
- Anomaly detection
