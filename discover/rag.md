Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that combines the strengths of traditional information retrieval systems—such as search engines and databases—with the advanced language capabilities of generative large language models (LLMs). By bridging your enterprise data with the world knowledge embedded in LLMs, RAG enables grounded, accurate, and context-aware outputs tailored to your specific business needs.

LLMs—the engine behind generative AI—can perform a wide range of tasks, from answering complex questions to generating original content. However, they have a critical limitation: they don’t inherently know your proprietary or up-to-date business data. This is where RAG becomes essential.

With RAG, businesses can seamlessly connect their internal data sources to LLMs, unlocking AI-driven capabilities that are more trustworthy, relevant, and timely. For example, once integrated with internal systems, RAG-enabled AI agents can provide customer service responses that reflect historical interactions or generate marketing briefs aligned with the latest brand guidelines.

### Business Benefits

1. **More Accurate and Reliable Answers**  
    RAG enhances generative AI by grounding its outputs in real-time enterprise data, significantly reducing hallucinations and ensuring responses are accurate, context-aware, and aligned with the latest company-specific information.

2. **Enterprise-Grade Data Security**  
    Sensitive business data is retrieved dynamically at runtime rather than being stored or fine-tuned into the model. This approach safeguards intellectual property and compliance-critical information, making it well-suited for regulated industries.

3. **Faster Decision-Making**  
    Employees receive instant, intelligent answers without the need to sift through reports, emails, or documents—significantly reducing time spent on data retrieval, interpretation, and back-and-forth communication.

4. **Cost-Efficient AI Adoption**  
    RAG eliminates the need for costly fine-tuning of large language models by using retrieval instead of retraining. This significantly reduces infrastructure costs by leveraging existing enterprise knowledge sources such as SAP HANA Cloud, SharePoint, and internal document repositories.
